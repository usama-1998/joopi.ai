## 🎨 Design System & Aesthetics

This project relies heavily on a premium, dark-mode-inspired aesthetic:
- **Bespoke Visuals**: Over-reliance on generic icons is avoided. Instead, bespoke CSS-driven mockups (e.g., iPhone chat frames, CRM dashboards, glowing node graphs) are used to visualize complex AI operations.
- **Outcome-Driven Copy**: Services and features are highlighted using direct, quantifiable business outcomes (e.g., "18% boost in new revenue") rather than just dense paragraphs.
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle translucent backgrounds (`backdrop-blur`) and glowing gradients (`shadow-[0_0_15px_...]`) are used to create depth.
- **Custom Animations**: Includes continuous, buttery-smooth CSS hover animations (`animate-float-smooth`) crafted specifically for UI elements like the logo pointer.
- **Responsive Clip-Paths**: Unique angled section dividers are implemented using CSS `clip-path` calculations synchronized with CSS variables across breakpoints.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🚀 Deployment (Netlify)

This project is configured for continuous deployment on Netlify.
A `netlify.toml` file is included in the root directory to automatically handle build settings and client-side routing (SPAs):
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Redirects**: All traffic `/*` routes to `/index.html` to prevent 404s on page refresh.
